# ExtensionKit
A compilation of helpers for iOS frameworks written in Swift.

## Description
This is basically a compilation of web's and my own useful snippets.

This Kit is based around the **extension** feature of Swift, which follows the Decorator Design pattern and has been with iOS since Objective-C (with its **categories**), but no Objective-C here, just Swift :thumbsup:. 

The motivation behind this set of Extensions is to have a very modular list of helpers for the sometimes lacking of very common use cases for iOS classes or simply to make existing functionality easier to use or read.

## Pod
To install all extensions as a Pod use:

#### Swift 4.0
```ruby
pod 'ExtensionKit', :git => 'https://github.com/victormarcias/ExtensionKit.git', :tag => '0.1.0'
```
#### Swift 4.2
```ruby
pod 'ExtensionKit', :git => 'https://github.com/victormarcias/ExtensionKit.git', :tag => '0.1.2'
```
#### Swift 5.0
```ruby
pod 'ExtensionKit', :git => 'https://github.com/victormarcias/ExtensionKit.git', :tag => '0.5.0'
```

Or use 'master' for the latest release or specify the version you want.

```ruby
pod 'ExtensionKit', :git => 'https://github.com/victormarcias/ExtensionKit.git', :branch => 'master'
```

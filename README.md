# ExtensionKit
A compilation of helpers for iOS frameworks written in Swift.

## Description
This is basically a compilation of web's and my own useful snippets.

This Kit is based around the **extension** feature of Swift, which follows the Decorator Design pattern and has been with iOS since Objective-C (with its **categories**), but no Objective-C here, just Swift :thumbsup:. 

The motivation behind this set of Extensions is to have a very modular list of helpers for the sometimes lacking of very common use cases for iOS classes or simply to make existing functionality easier to use or read.

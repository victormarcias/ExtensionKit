# ExtensionKit
A list of helpers for Cocoa Touch frameworks written in Swift.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this set of Extensions is to have a very modular list of helpers for the sometimes lacking of very common use cases for iOS classes, either by adding funcionatlity or simply adding syntactic sugar for cleaner code.
